You‚Äôre grocery shopping. You walk into the store, knowing exactly what you need for the week. As you start walking down the isles, you notice a new flavour of crisps from your favourite brand is out. You put that item into your trolley. üõç 
In the next aisle, you pass by some cookies and feel a little peckish. You grab one pack. In another section, you find out that there is a ‚ÄúBuy 3 for 2 discount‚Äù. Excited, you buy those items even though you will not eat all of it. 
You reach the checkout counter and realize that your bill is higher than you expected. But how could this be? You only bought the necessary stuff, right? You shrug your shoulders and say to yourself ‚ÄúWe have to eat.‚Äù. You pay the bill and go home. 
Grocery shopping is one example of how we spend too much money on food. Too often, we make exceptions when it comes to food. Here are a few quick hacks to spend less on food üòã 
Cook together üç≥ 
The UAE is famous for its brunches. With unlimited bubbles and delicious dishes, it is no wonder that everybody flocks to them. But if you notice that lately, your budget has been tight and your waist is filling out, then perhaps it is time to ditch the fancy buffets. 
Why not spend the weekend organizing a BBQ with your friends and family? Cooking together allows you to purchase in bulk to cook larger portions. Shopping in bulk is a guaranteed saving outlet. Plus, the quality time that you spend together will be just as fulfilling.

2. Ordering Take-Out? ü•° <br>
There is nothing better than kicking your feet up on the couch, with a warm meal and Netflix, after a long day of work. Unfortunately, your wallet ends up looking quite empty after all of those take-out nights. 
Cooking at home can be a much better and healthier alternative. You can buy cheaper raw ingredients and control what is going into your food. Is time a factor? No problem, there is a solution. Organize a meal prep over the weekend so that you have food ready for the rest of the week. 
For those of us who cannot cook, there are affordable subscription-based meal delivery options out there. Blue Apron is one example. They will provide you with a step by step recipe guide and you will receive ingredients in perfect portions. <br>

3. Stop Buying Overpriced Coffee. ‚òï <br>
I can‚Äôt stress this advice enough. 
Stop. Buying. Overpriced. Coffee. It is an unnecessary expense. 
Here‚Äôs some quick math that will make you think twice before your next coffee pick- up. 
In the UAE, a Starbucks Latte costs around AED 20. 
For a week, that‚Äôs: 
AED 20 x 7 = AED 140. 

For a month, that‚Äôs 
AED 140x4= AED 560 
For a year, THAT‚Äôs 
AED 560x12= AAAAAAAH. 
So much money that could be spent much more wisely. Make your coffee at home instead and buy yourself a good flask. <br>

4. Do not overspend on pre-packaged products. ü•ó <br>
The next time you find yourself reaching out for sliced vegetables or diced fruit, ask yourself if this is a necessary expense. Consumer savings expert, Andrea Woroch, states that these products can be marked up to as high as 40%. Is it worth paying for such products when instead, you could spend an extra five minutes on such a simple task? 
Choose to buy loose fruits and veg to save money in the long run. On the plus side, loose fruit and veg have a longer storage life. Nutrients are lost in precut fruit and veg because of heat, oxygen and light. This means that they will spoil faster and they should be consumed immediately. <br>

5. Find out where to buy the best groceries üè™ <br>
Different supermarkets will offer products at different price ranges so it is better to shop around. It is a good idea to keep up to date with supermarket deals. There are grocery store price comparison apps out there to help you make more money-wise decisions when it comes to food expenses. <br>

6. Loyalty Programs are the best! ü§ù <br>
Loyalty programs, such as Carrefour‚Äôs MyCLUB and Union Co-op‚Äôs Tamayaz Card, can greatly benefit you in the long run. Earn points while you shop, and receive rewards and special deals on your next purchase. <br>

7. Buying snacks at the petrol station ‚õΩ <br>
This is something that you may not realize is a contributing factor in draining your budget. The same drinks and snacks at the petrol station are usually more expensive in comparison to large supermarket chains. If you are somebody that tends to buy a snack or two every time you refuel your car, then this adds up over the month. 
8. Carry water and snacks with you. üç´ <br>
You never know when you may get peckish. A meeting at work may have lasted longer than you initially planned. You got stuck in traffic. 
These are the times where you will appreciate that granola bar and water sitting in your bag. They will stop you from driving by the closest petrol station or popping by the nearest shop to buy food.

The Grand Finale; Closing Food For Thought. ü§î <br>
We all know that we could do a little more to save money. Going out for overpriced lunch here and there is not a bad thing‚Ä¶ until it turns into a habit. That is when your wallet takes a hit. 
In other situations, such as grocery shopping, our eyes tend to see more than we can eat. We buy more food than we need, and then we are left with food waste and less money. Make your wallet happy by only buying the food that you know you will eat.
